FINDING.
***
The Congress finds that assistance provided by the United States 
under the Support for East European Democracy (SEED) Act of 1989, the 
Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, and other laws to the countries of 
Eastern Europe has helped several of those countries to make 
considerable progress toward democratic governance that respects the 
rights of all citizens of those countries regardless of ethnic 
background and toward a market-based economy that may contribute to the 
prosperity that reinforces democratic government, multiethnic harmony, 
peace, and stability.
***
SEC. 102.
***
POLICY.
***
The Congress declares the following:
            (1) As United States assistance programs for several 
        countries of northeastern Europe authorized under the Support 
        for East European Democracy (SEED) Act of 1989 approach their 
        end, the United States, in cooperation with its allies in the 
        North Atlantic Alliance, the member countries of the European 
        Union, and with other bilateral and multilateral donors, will 
        continue to provide targeted assistance to the countries of 
        southeastern Europe, including the Republic of Slovenia, the 
        Republic of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of 
        Albania, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the 
        Republic of Bulgaria, and Romania, in support of its interest 
        in the larger pan-European and trans-Atlantic community of 
        states.
***
(2) Programs authorized under the Support for East European 
        Democracy (SEED) Act of 1989 and the Foreign Assistance Act of 
        1961 will continue to play an important role in assisting the 
        countries of southeastern Europe to address challenges to 
        political and economic reforms.
***
SEC. 103. AUTHORIZATION OF ASSISTANCE TO THE COUNTRIES OF SOUTHEASTERN 
              EUROPE.
***
(a) Support for Political and Economic Reforms in Southeastern 
Europe.--The President is authorized to provide appropriate support for 
political and economic reforms in the countries of southeastern Europe 
from the amount appropriated for fiscal year 2001 to carry out the 
Support for East European Democracy (SEED) Act of 1989 (22 U.S.C. 5401

seq.).
***
(b) Support for Political and Economic Reforms in the Kosovo 
Region.--The President is authorized to provide appropriate support for 
political and economic reforms in the Kosovo region of the Republic of 
Serbia from the amount appropriated for fiscal year 2001 to carry out 
the Support for East European Democracy (SEED) Act of 1989 (22 U.S.C. 
5401 et seq.) and the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 et 
seq.).
***
(c) Limitation on Assistance for the Republic of Serbia.--
            (1) Limitation.--Assistance may not be provided for the 
        Republic of Serbia under any provision of law, except pursuant 
        to title II of this Act, or for strictly humanitarian purposes, 
        from the amount appropriated for fiscal year 2001 to carry out 
        the Support for East European Democracy (SEED) Act of 1989 (22 
        U.S.C. 5401 et seq.) and the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 
        U.S.C. 2151 et seq.).
***
(2) Exception.--The limitation in paragraph (1) shall not 
        apply if the President determines that the Government of Serbia 
        has undertaken steps to become truly democratic and to ensure 
        equal rights for all citizens of the Republic of Serbia.
***
SEC. 104. DEFINITION OF COUNTRIES OF SOUTHEASTERN EUROPE.
***
In this title, the term ``countries of southeastern Europe'' means 
the Republic of Slovenia, the Republic of Croatia, Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, the Republic of Albania, the Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia, the Republic of Bulgaria, and Romania.
***
TITLE II--ASSISTANCE FOR DEMOCRACY BUILDING IN THE REPUBLIC OF SERBIA 
                     AND THE REPUBLIC OF MONTENEGRO

SEC. 201. FINDINGS.
***
The Congress finds the following:
            (1) In multi-party elections held in the Republic of Serbia 
        in 1990, 1992, 1996, and 1997, international observers found 
        considerable evidence of election fraud and manipulation of the 
        state-run media, allowing the ruling Socialist Party of Serbia, 
        led by Slobodan Milosevic, to maintain power.
***
(2) On many occasions, and specifically in 1991, 1996, and 
        1997, Serbian authorities demonstrated a willingness to 
        intimidate and use force against citizens of Serbia who 
        peacefully exercised their rights to protest publicly against 
        the regime's undemocratic practices.
***
(3) Beginning in 1991, the Serbian Government formed by the 
        Socialist Party of Serbia sought to enhance its power and 
        counter democratic pressures by fomenting extreme nationalism 
        and instigating interethnic conflict within the former 
        Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which, by the time 
        peace was restored in 1999, resulted in the deaths of hundreds 
        of thousands, the torture and rape of tens of thousands, and 
        the forced displacement of nearly 4,000,000 individuals.
***
(4) In 1992, the Republics of Serbia and Montenegro 
        asserted the establishment of a new ``Federal Republic of 
        Yugoslavia'', the government and institutions of which have 
        been dominated by those holding power in Serbia and their 
        political allies in Montenegro, enabling Serbian President 
        Slobodan Milosevic to become the President of the new Yugoslav 
        state in 1997, when his final term as President of Serbia 
        ended.
***
(5) In 1997 and 1998, forces within the ruling Democratic 
        Socialist Party of Montenegro which supported the building of 
        democratic institutions separated from those allied with the 
        ruling party in Serbia, cooperated with opposition parties, 
        including those representing minority communities, and 
        succeeded, despite threats and intimidation on the part of 
        Serbian officials, in holding elections reflective of the will 
        of the citizens of Montenegro and bringing increased openness 
        and tolerance in Montenegrin society.
***
(6) In 1998, conflict in the area resumed with an assault 
        by Yugoslav military and Serbian police and security forces on 
        innocent civilians in Kosovo which ultimately led, in 1999, to 
        an all-out campaign to ethnically cleanse Kosovo of its 
        Albanian population.
***
(7) In 1998, new, draconian laws on information and higher 
        education placed further restrictions on the independent media 
        and academic freedom in Serbia.
***
(8) Military intervention by the North Atlantic Treaty 
        Organization (NATO) to compel Yugoslav and Serbian officials to 
        end the repression in Kosovo was used by these officials to 
        attack independent and opposition forces within Serbia, both 
        verbally and physically, and to impose additional restrictions 
        on the rights and freedoms of the people of Serbia.
***
(9) The chronology of events in Serbia since 1990 indicates 
        a clear relationship between the instigation of interethnic 
        conflict and the denial of democratic development.
***
SEC. 202.
***
POLICY TOWARD THE REPUBLIC OF SERBIA AND THE REPUBLIC OF 
              MONTENEGRO.
***
The Congress declares that the United States supports the 
development of democracy in Serbia and Montenegro and those who are 
committed to the building of democratic institutions, defending human 
rights, promoting rule of law, and fostering tolerance in society.
***
SEC. 203. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING RECONSTRUCTION IN THE 
              REPUBLIC OF SERBIA.
***
It is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) the United States should not provide bilateral 
        assistance to rebuild the civilian infrastructure in the 
        Republic of Serbia, but, should provide assistance for purposes 
        of democratization within the Republic of Serbia in order to 
        support a change in the character of its government with regard 
        to policies that foment interethnic conflict;
            (2) in the event that the character of the Government of 
        the Republic of Serbia changes through demonstrable 
        implementation of policies in support of democracy, interethnic 
        harmony, and market-based economic reform, bilateral assistance 
        for economic reforms may then be made available as well; and
            (3) the United States should provide support for civilian 
        infrastructure in the Republic of Serbia, in particular where 
        the local government implements democratic policy, supports 
        interethnic harmony, and seeks market-based economic reforms, 
        through support for programs managed by international financial 
        institutions.

***
TITLE III--ASSISTANCE TO THE REPUBLIC OF MONTENEGRO

SEC. 301. FINDINGS.
***
The Congress finds the following:
            (1) The election of former Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo 
        Djukanovic to the office of President of the Republic of 
        Montenegro in October 1997 was followed by a new program of 
        political and economic reforms in Montenegro and a policy of 
        pursuing greater links between Montenegro and the international 
        community.
***
(2) In May 1998, the governing coalition headed by 
        President Djukanovic, a multiethnic coalition committed to 
        respect the rights of all of Montenegro's citizens, regardless 
        of ethnic background, won parliamentary elections in the 
        Republic of Montenegro.
***
(3) The Republic of Serbia, in cooperation with the 
        president of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Slobodan 
        Milosevic, has sought to obstruct the efforts of the Republic 
        of Montenegro to implement political and economic reforms by 
        means of--
                    (A) economic boycotts against Montenegro;
                    (B) manipulation of information in the state-run 
                media with the intent of destabilizing Montenegro;
                    (C) illegitimate manipulation of the Federal 
                parliament of Serbia and Montenegro; and
                    (D) alleged support for armed demonstrations in 
                January 1998 in Montenegro against the democratically-
                elected government.
***
(4) In May 1998 the Republic of Montenegro ended the 
        transfer of tax revenues to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
        because of the illegitimate appointment of the Prime Minister 
        of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and later took control 
        from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia of the licensing of 
        mass media, the levy of customs duties, and the approval of 
        export and import licenses within the territory of Montenegro.
***
(5) The Republic of Montenegro has allowed newspapers and 
        periodicals that had been banned in neighboring Serbia to 
        publish in Montenegro.
***
(6) Officials of the Republic of Montenegro have expressed 
        a willingness to work with investigators from the International 
        Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).
***
(7) President Milo Djukanovic of the Republic of Montenegro 
        had supported efforts to maintain peace and address the 
        concerns of ethnic Albanians in the Serbian region of Kosovo by 
        calling for dialogue and the grant of substantial autonomy to 
        the Kosovo region prior to the outbreak of the conflict in 
        Serbia over the region.
***
(8) Prior to, and after the start of the military operation 
        of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in Serbia, the 
        Republic of Montenegro accepted tens of thousands of refugees 
        from the neighboring region of Kosovo in Serbia.

POLICY TOWARD THE REPUBLIC OF MONTENEGRO.

***
SEC. 303. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.
***
It is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) the Government of the Republic of Montenegro should 
        undertake concrete steps to end corrupt activities within 
        Montenegro;
            (2) the Government of the Republic of Montenegro should 
        undertake to ensure that the process of privatization of state-
        owned enterprises in Montenegro is fair and transparent;
            (3) the Government of the Republic of Montenegro should 
        take steps to divest itself of its control over the major media 
        outlets within Montenegro to ensure greater freedom of the 
        media;
            (4) the implementation of full economic and political 
        reforms within the Republic of Montenegro by a multiethnic 
        government may serve as a model for such successful reforms and 
        greater ethnic tolerance within Serbia should a more democratic 
        government come to power in that neighboring state; and
            (5) the United States should join other official creditors 
        of the Republic of Montenegro in providing Montenegro with 
        relief from official debt through rescheduling and, where 
        appropriate, forgiveness.

        citizens, regardless of ethnic background;
            (2) to support the territorial integrity of Macedonia and 
        to insist that the territorial integrity of Macedonia be

        political movements within and outside Macedonia;
            (3) to support cooperative, bilateral relations between 
        Macedonia and all neighboring countries;

        economic, financial, humanitarian, and other assistance that 
        may be provided to the region by the United States and other 
        donors due to its important role in the stability of the region 
        and its acceptance of a large share of the economic burden 
        caused by the large influx of refugees into Macedonia during 
        the recent conflict with regard to the region of Kosovo.

SEC. 402. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.
***
It is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is to be 
        commended for efforts undertaken since independence to support 
        the creation of a free media, including the creation of an 
        environment in which privately-owned radio and television 
        stations and newspapers have been established, and should 
        further encourage the growth of a free media by privatizing 
        media outlets and newsprint distribution enterprises that allow 
the government to control the free flow of alternative media;
            (2) Macedonia is to be commended for steps taken since 
        independence to ensure better educational opportunities for its 
        citizens of ethnic Albanian background, including steps that 
        have resulted in rising enrollments by those of ethnic Albanian 
        background in Macedonian secondary schools and universities and 
        the creation of a Pedagogical Faculty at Skopje University for 
        the training of ethnic Albanian primary and secondary school 
        teachers;
            (3) officials of the Government of Macedonia should 
        continue to ensure rising enrollments for those citizens of 
        ethnic Albanian background in Macedonian schools and 
        universities;
            (4) United States assistance programs in support of 
        political reforms in Macedonia should be expanded, with a 
        particular focus on privatization of state-owned media 
        enterprises, improvements in public administration at both the 
        central and local levels of government, and efforts to improve 
        inter-ethnic understanding and cooperation, particularly in the 
        area of broadcast and print media operations, both public and 
        private;
            (5) the United States should, in particular, expand its 
        microenterprise credit and loan programs in Macedonia to 
        encourage the growth of small business and job creation that 
        will help alleviate unemployment;
            (6) the United States should join other official creditors 
        of Macedonia in providing Macedonia with relief from such 
        official debt through rescheduling and, where appropriate, 
        forgiveness; and
            (7) United States assistance programs for the modernization 
        of Macedonia's armed forces through training and provision of 
        equipment should be expanded, with a particular focus on border 
        security and efforts to increase the representation of citizens 
        of ethnic Albanian background in the officer corps of those 
        armed forces.

TITLE VI--POLICY REGARDING INDIVIDUALS INDICTED BY THE INTERNATIONAL 
              CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL FOR THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA

SEC. 601. FINDINGS.
***
The Congress finds the following:
            (1) On May 25, 1993, United Nations Security Council 
        Resolution 827 established the International Criminal Tribunal 
        for the former Yugoslavia located in The Hague, the Netherlands 
        (hereinafter in this title referred to as the ``Tribunal''), 
        and gave it jurisdiction over all crimes arising out of the 
        conflict in the former Yugoslavia.
***
(2) This Tribunal has publicly indicted 93 individuals for 
        war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide arising out 
        of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, including the 
        indictment of Slobodon Milosevic and other senior political 
        leaders, and has issued a number of indictments under seal.
***
(3) The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the 
        Crime of Genocide defines genocide as ``any of the following 
        acts committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, 
        a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group, as such: (a) 
        Killing members of the group; (b) Causing serious bodily or 
        mental harm to members of the group; (c) Deliberately 
        inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring 
        about its physical destruction in whole or in part; (d) 
        Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; 
        [or] (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another 
        group.''.
***
(4) There is reason to believe that known war criminals 
        live freely in the former Yugoslavia, not fearful of arrest, 
        and any lasting peace in the region must be based on justice 
        for all, including the most senior officials of the government 
        or governments responsible for conceiving, organizing, 
        initiating, directing, and sustaining the Yugoslav conflict and 
        whose forces have committed war crimes, crimes against 
        humanity, or genocide.

DECLARATION OF POLICY.
***
(a) In General.--The Congress declares that it is the policy of the 
United States to assist the Tribunal as fully as possible in its 
apprehension and prosecution of individuals indicted for war crimes, 
including Slobodan Milosevic, and to encourage the other members of the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and other interested 
countries to do the same.
***
(b) Additional Declarations of Policy.--The Congress further 
declares the following:
            (1) The United States should make collection of information 
        that can be supplied to the Tribunal for use as evidence to 
        support the prosecution of individuals indicted for war crimes 
        a higher priority, with any such information already collected 
immediately turned over to the Tribunal.
***
(2) The United States should provide an adequate amount of 
        any additional financial or personnel resources that may be 
        required by the Tribunal in order to enable the Tribunal to 
        adequately prepare for, indict, prosecute, and adjudicate 
        allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide 
        posed against President Slobodan Milosevic or any other 
        individual arising from the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, 
        including in Kosovo.
***
(3) The United States should publicly declare that it 
        considers that there is reason to believe that Slobodan 
        Milosevic, President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
        (Serbia and Montenegro), is responsible for genocide.
***
(4) The United States should urge the Tribunal to promptly 
        review all information relating to President Slobodan 
        Milosevic's possible criminal culpability for conceiving, 
        directing, and sustaining a variety of actions in the former 
        Yugoslavia, including Kosovo, that constitute genocide, crimes 
        against humanity, or war crimes.
***
(5) The United States should engage with other members of 
        the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and other 
        interested countries in a discussion of information any such 
        nation may hold relating to allegations of war crimes and 
        crimes against humanity or genocide charged against President 
        Slobodan Milosevic and any other individual arising from the 
        conflict in the former Yugoslavia, including in Kosovo, and 
        urge such nations to promptly provide all such information to 
        the Tribunal.
***
(6) The United States should engage with other members of 
        NATO and other interested countries in a discussion of measures 
        to be taken to apprehend individuals indicted for war crimes or 
        crimes against humanity with the objective of concluding a plan 
        of action that will result in the prompt delivery of the 
        indictees into the custody of the Tribunal, and such plan 
        should include the imposition of economic and political 
        sanctions on any country known to be harboring an indicted 
        individual.
